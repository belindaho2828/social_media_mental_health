# social_media_mental_health
An analysis of the impact of social media usage on young people in 2022 (Bangladesh).
Original dataset downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/souvikahmed071/social-media-and-mental-health.
Analysis was performed by Meredith Jones, Celina Kamler, and Belinda Ho.
This assignment was completed as a requirement for the UC Berkeley Data Analytics & Data Visualization Boot Camp in March 2024.
Extra care was taken to ensure we conducted original analysis; we explored different questions from the dataset creator. 
Our team focused on exploring the following research question: Does social media usage impact mental health differently for women?

## Tools Used ##
Analysis was performed in Jupyter Notebook using the following Python libraries: Pandas, MatPlotLib, Numpy, Scipy, and Seaborn. 

# Summary of Dataset #

## Gender ##
Our dataset had slightly more male-identifying survey participants than other genders at 54.7% followed by Females at 43.9%, Non-binary at 1.2%, and trans at 0.2%. 

## Age ##
The age distribution of the survey participants in our dataset has a relatively small standard deviation compared to the total age range (i.e., 9.5 standard deviation in a dataset with age range 13-69). This means most of the data is clustered around the mean age of 26. Additionally, the median age of the survey participants in our dataset is 22. This is consistent with the fact that the survey was conducted as part of a project for a university statistics course. There are 83 outliers out of 480 records, about 17% of all survey participants. Although the distribution of the dataset is not very large and mostly represents a younger demographic, there is still representation across a wide age range. 

It is important to keep in mind that this sample is representative of a younger population and may not be  representative of the population as a whole and the results should not be extrapolated to draw conclusions as such.

## Platforms Used ##
The top 3 platforms that the survey participants in our dataset use are YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. Although our sample has more males-identifying participants overall, there are more female-identifying participants that use the top 3 platforms and across all other platforms except for Twitter, Discord, and Reddit.

## Average Time Spent ## 
Nearly a quarter of all respondents used social media for more than 5 hours per day. 54% reported using social media between 2 and 5 hours/day.

116 out of 480 of the survey participants, or 24%, spent more than 5 hours on social media. This was the highest count of participants out of all time ranges, followed by the 2-3 hour and 3-4 hour ranges at 21% and 19% respectively. The vast majority  (77%) of those that said they spent 5+ hours on social media fell within the 18-24 age range, even though they only represent 62% of the total dataset. 

# Conclusion #
1) We found differences in mental health outcomes for female respondents aged 21 and under in the area of feelings of depression
2) Mental health challenges appear to be greater for users who spend more time on social media
3) Tiktok had the highest scores on the constructs for inattention, validation seeking, and depression
4) Patterns of inattention were correlated with feelings of depression
